CS_Related,Have,Not Have,"In the Merge Sort Algorithm, the unsorted array is divided into two unsorted arrays. This splitting process keeps going until all sub-arrays are sorted. Then the algorithm starts to combine them into a large array. This process keeps going until there is only one array, and that array is the final answer. ",correct,agree,Agree,"In the closest pair of points algorithm, the initial graph is divided into two graphs. This dividing process keeps going until the sub-graph has the closest pair. Then the algorithm combines each answer of the sub-graphs to find the final closest pair.",correct,agree,Agree,Algorithm Steps ,good UI,No Trouble,8,"I believe that a high-level understanding can help me grasp the fundamental principles and purposes of algorithms without delving into the intricacies, which is very beneficial for me. Additionally, excellent UI design can aid me in comprehending the basic principles of algorithms more quickly."

CS_Related,Have,Have,"Merge Sort is an divde-and-conquer algorithm that you first divde the input into individual groups, which can be sorted in constant O(1) time, and then merge these sorted individual groups together.",correct,agree,Agree,"Similiar to the merge sort, you divide the points into groups of two, calculate and compare the distance in O(1) time, and repeat doing so till you find the closest pair.",correct,agree,Agree,Algorithm Steps ,good UI,No Trouble,10,"Adding a extra control ""backward"" so that user can go back and force between a step. If any step is not clear enough, the user doesn't need to restart from the begining. "
CS_Related,Have,Have,Devide the unsorted array and conquer by merging them in order.,correct,agree,Agree,Devide the graph and conquer by finding the closest point.,correct,agree,Agree,Code + Steps,good UI,No Trouble,10,Very interesting. Would be better to have pseudo-code and be able to visualize each step of the algorithm with the corresponding line of code.
CS_Related,Have,Have,"The merge sort algorithm split a long list into 2 sublist, sort each one of them, then merge the sorted lists.",correct,agree,Agree,"The algorithm split the space into 2 subspaces, than find the ***closest*** pair for each subspace. When merge, also consider the area between two subspaces.",correct,neutral,Disagree,Algorithm Steps ,good UI,Have Trouble,7,"1. It would be better if there is some explanation about what is going on when I click the ""next"" button;
2. For the closest pair algorithm, it would be better if the entire space can keep on the screen."

CS_Related,Have,Have,"In my eyes, Merge Sort follows divide-and-conquer approach. It is a reflection of recursion. Its time complexity is O(n log n), which makes it suitable for large datasets.  However, it requires additional memory space. I think this application is good for beginner to learn algorithm",correct,agree,Disagree,"The key insight of the algorithm is that it exploits the properties of the problem to efficiently eliminate many pairs of points that don't need to be considered.  By recursively dividing the problem and selectively considering potential closest pairs, the algorithm achieves an overall time complexity of O(n log n)",wrong,agree,Disagree,Code + Steps,good UI,No Trouble,6,I think Pseudo-code or something like the process of debug could add into the application. Beginner can understand the result of code and how the code execute.

Not_Related,Have,Not Have,"Merge sort Algorithm is put a string of non-sequential numbers in order. You need to divided it into two array, until all array are sorted.

Not_Related,Not Have,Not Have,it divides the array into small undividable units and merge it in sequence and then it is sorted out.,correct,neutral,Disagree,it divides the graph into different parts and pick a close pair randomly. then it compares any pair within that area to see if there is any pair shorter than the pair.,wrong,neutral,Disagree,Code + Steps,good UI,No Trouble,6,I think the instruction is a bit hard to understand.  maybe you can attach that below the buttons so that the users can view and understand their function while playing with it
