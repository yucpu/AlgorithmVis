Yes,Yes,No,"In the Merge Sort Algorithm, the unsorted array is divided into two unsorted arrays. This splitting process keeps going until all sub-arrays are sorted. Then the algorithm starts to combine them into a large array. This process keeps going until there is only one array, and that array is the final answer. ",Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,"In the closest pair of points algorithm, the initial graph is divided into two graphs. This dividing process keeps going until the sub-graph has the closest pair. Then the algorithm combines each answer of the sub-graphs to find the final closest pair.",Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,Algorithm Steps ,Yes,No,8,"I believe that a high-level understanding can help me grasp the fundamental principles and purposes of algorithms without delving into the intricacies, which is very beneficial for me. Additionally, excellent UI design can aid me in comprehending the basic principles of algorithms more quickly."
Yes,Yes,No,dividing a long string into parts and sort them seperately ,Yes,Neither agree nor disagree,Agree,the visualization is a bit hard to understand,No,Strongly disagree,Disagree,Algorithm Steps ,Yes,Yes,7,
Yes,Yes,No,fast and stable,No,Strongly agree,Agree,make question simple,No,Strongly agree,Agree,Code + Steps,Yes,No,8,
Yes,Yes,Yes,"Merge Sort is an divde-and-conquer algorithm that you first divde the input into individual groups, which can be sorted in constant O(1) time, and then merge these sorted individual groups together.",Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,"Similiar to the merge sort, you divide the points into groups of two, calculate and compare the distance in O(1) time, and repeat doing so till you find the closest pair.",Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,Algorithm Steps ,Yes,No,10,"Adding a extra control ""backward"" so that user can go back and force between a step. If any step is not clear enough, the user doesn't need to restart from the begining. "
Yes,Yes,Yes,Devide the unsorted array and conquer by merging them in order.,Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,Devide the graph and conquer by finding the closest point.,Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,Code + Steps,Yes,No,10,Very interesting. Would be better to have pseudo-code and be able to visualize each step of the algorithm with the corresponding line of code.
Yes,Yes,Yes,"The merge sort algorithm split a long list into 2 sublist, sort each one of them, then merge the sorted lists.",Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,"The algorithm split the space into 2 subspaces, than find the ***closest*** pair for each subspace. When merge, also consider the area between two subspaces.",Yes,Neither agree nor disagree,Disagree,Algorithm Steps ,Yes,Yes,7,"1. It would be better if there is some explanation about what is going on when I click the ""next"" button;
2. For the closest pair algorithm, it would be better if the entire space can keep on the screen."
Yes,Yes,No,"Repeatedly segment array until only one element remains, then compare and merge",Yes,Strongly disagree,Agree,Can’t understand ,No,Strongly disagree,Disagree,Algorithm Steps ,Yes,Yes,3,"Make a low level version for comparison, or at least give a link of low level"
Yes,Yes,Yes,"In my eyes, Merge Sort follows divide-and-conquer approach. It is a reflection of recursion. Its time complexity is O(n log n), which makes it suitable for large datasets.  However, it requires additional memory space. I think this application is good for beginner to learn algorithm",Yes,Strongly agree,Disagree,"The key insight of the algorithm is that it exploits the properties of the problem to efficiently eliminate many pairs of points that don't need to be considered.  By recursively dividing the problem and selectively considering potential closest pairs, the algorithm achieves an overall time complexity of O(n log n)",No,Strongly agree,Disagree,Code + Steps,Yes,No,6,I think Pseudo-code or something like the process of debug could add into the application. Beginner can understand the result of code and how the code execute. 
No,No,Yes,An algorithm that divide big groups into 2 small groups and rank them,Yes,Strongly agree,Disagree,Useful tools,No,Strongly agree,Disagree,Code + Steps,Yes,Yes,9,It has great future and help handle many things
No,No,No," Merge Sort breaks a list into single pieces, then puts them back together in order, step by step.",Yes,Neither agree nor disagree,Disagree,The Closest Pair of Points Algorithm finds the two points with the smallest distance between them in a set of points,No,Strongly agree,Disagree,Code + Steps,Yes,Yes,8,Algorithm Visualization is like a map for understanding how algorithms work. It makes complex ideas easier to grasp by showing each step in a visual way.
No,Yes,Yes,Goood,No,Strongly agree,Agree,useful,No,Strongly agree,Agree,Algorithm Steps ,Yes,Yes,10,more convenience design
No,Yes,No,"Merge sort Algorithm is put a string of non-sequential numbers in order. You need to divided it into two array, until all array are sorted. Then combine them, numbers will be ordered.",Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,"In the closest pair of points algorithm, the initial graph is divided into two graphs. This dividing process keeps going until the sub-graph has the closest pair. Then the algorithm combines each answer of the sub-graphs to find the final closest pair",Yes,Strongly agree,Agree,Code + Steps,Yes,Yes,10,"The overall design is great, it is very simple to make the code become visual, and the process of adding each step of the code will be more understandable!"
No,No,No,it divides the array into small undividable units and merge it in sequence and then it is sorted out.,Yes,Neither agree nor disagree,Disagree,it divides the graph into different parts and pick a close pair randomly. then it compares any pair within that area to see if there is any pair shorter than the pair.,No,Neither agree nor disagree,Disagree,Code + Steps,Yes,No,6,I think the instruction is a bit hard to understand.  maybe you can attach that below the buttons so that the users can view and understand their function while playing with it
No,No,No,It first separates then compares and sorts the data ,Yes,Neither agree nor disagree,Agree,I don’t know,No,Strongly disagree,Disagree,Code + Steps,Yes,No,6,
