## What is Algorithm Viusalization ?

<p style="text-align:justify">
Algorithm Visualization is a way to explain the definition and show the execution of the algorithm with charts, animation, and interactive stimulation on one screen at the same time. It
can be an effective tool in a variety of fields, especially the field of computer science education.
Students who are learning the algorithm can get a better understanding through visual cognition than just reading the text definition because the image provides more useful information [4]. It is also an ideal educational tool for the educator [5]

## Why We need Algorithm Visualization ? 
<p style="text-align:justify">
For most computer science students, learning algorithms well has never been an easy task because every algorithm has a unique logic. And, the execution of the algorithm is dynamic and abstract [2]; it is hard to simulate the process
of the algorithm in the head. Moreover, the traditional method of teaching algorithm which uses the blackboard is not effective [2]. Learning algorithm with visualization is an effective method in the education of algorithms. It triggers students’ active learning behavior [3].

## The Goal of this Project !
<p style="text-align:justify">
This project aims to design and build a divide-and-conquer Algorithm Visualization tool that provides interactive animation of a series of divide-and-conquer algorithms to the learner while they are learning the concepts of the divide-and-conquer algorithm. The solution not only provides the execution of the code, and visual change of data but also allows the learner to understand the algorithm with a high-level view; the learner can control the phase of the algorithm freely, such as dividing the data, solving sub-data set, go forwards, go backward, and
merging answers. With such interaction with data and code, the learner can easily understand lengthy concepts and obscure codes of divide-and-conquer algorithms.
